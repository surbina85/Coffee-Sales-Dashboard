This a project from Maven Analytics. Go to this [link](https://mavenanalytics.io/project/21796) to see the project page.

I have also created a similar version in Tableau that you can see [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sergio.urbina5986/viz/MavenRoastersSalesDashboard_17308180238370/Dashboard).

## Background

Maven Roasters, a New York City coffee shop chain with three locations, is looking to better understand customer purchasing patterns to optimize operations. They gathered transactional data from January to June 2023 to support this goal.



## Project Objectives

1. **Data Preparation:** Clean and organise the data in Microsoft Excel.
2. **Data Exploration:** Analyse customer purchasing behaviour and identify key trends across locations.
3. **Dashboard Creation:** Develop an interactive dashboard to provide Maven Roastersâ€™ management team with insights into sales performance across the three branches.

## Highlights

- Overall sales have increased steadily over the first half of 2023, with only a small dip during February
- Saturdays show the lowest sales overall and in the Lower Manhattan branch Sundays have a slightly lower volume than Saturdays
- Busiest day of the week for the whole chain are Fridays. On a branch level, it varies a bit more:
    - Thursdays for Astoria branch
    - Fridays for Hell's Kitchen
    - Mondays for Lower Manhattan
- 6am, 7pm, and 8pm have the lowest volume of sales, but when looked deeper on an branch level, they show that this is not uniform:
    - Lower Manhattan's lowest volumes are at 7pm and 8pm
    - Hell's Kitchen's lowest volume is at 8pm
    - Astoria has consistent volumes across all hours
- During April, weekends have stronger sales than weekdays, which is interesting and worth more exploration
- Coffee and Tea are the most popular product categories
- Brewed Chai Tea, Gourmet Brewed Coffe, and Barista Espresso are the top 3 products overall by volume, but Barista Espresso bring in the highest revenue.
