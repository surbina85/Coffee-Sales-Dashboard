## Background

Maven Roasters, a New York City coffee shop chain with three locations, is looking to gain a deeper understanding of customer purchasing patterns to optimize operations. To support this goal, they gathered transactional data from January to June 2023.



## Project Objectives

1. **Data Preparation:** Clean and organise the data in Microsoft Excel.
2. **Data Exploration:** Analyse customer purchasing behaviour and identify key trends across locations.
3. **Dashboard Creation:** Developed an interactive MS Excel dashboard to provide Maven Roastersâ€™ management team with insights into sales performance across the three branches.



## Highlights

- Overall sales have increased steadily over the first half of 2023, with only a small dip during February
- Saturdays show the lowest sales overall and in the Lower Manhattan branch Sundays have a slightly lower volume than Saturdays
- Busiest day of the week for the whole chain are Fridays. On a branch level, it varies a bit more:
    - Thursdays for Astoria branch
    - Fridays for Hell's Kitchen
    - Mondays for Lower Manhattan
- 6am, 7pm, and 8pm have the lowest volume of sales, but when looked deeper on an branch level, they show that this is not uniform:
    - Lower Manhattan's lowest volumes are at 7pm and 8pm
    - Hell's Kitchen's lowest volume is at 8pm
    - Astoria has consistent volumes across all hours
- During April, weekends have stronger sales than weekdays, which is interesting and worth more exploration
- Coffee and Tea are the most popular product categories
- Brewed Chai Tea, Gourmet Brewed Coffe, and Barista Espresso are the top 3 products overall by volume, but Barista Espresso bring in the highest revenue.
